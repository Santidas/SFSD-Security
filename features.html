    <div class="container">
      <!-- Feature block: Real‑Time Monitoring -->
      <div class="detail-block reveal">
        <h2>Real‑Time Monitoring</h2>
        <p>Our human agents keep eyes on your cameras around the clock. While many systems rely solely on recorded footage, we take a proactive approach — our observers are trained to spot suspicious behavior, safety hazards and operational issues as they happen. This ensures incidents are addressed immediately rather than after the fact.</p>
        <p>Every shift follows strict protocols and checklists to make sure nothing is missed. We tailor our monitoring to your specific environment, whether you manage a retail store, restaurant, warehouse or other facility. The result? Peace of mind that someone is always watching over your assets and staff.</p>

      <!-- Feature block: AI Behavior Detection -->
      <div class="detail-block reveal">
        <h2>AI Behavior Detection</h2>
        <p>We build proprietary AI models that analyze your video feeds in real time. These models are trained to recognize patterns indicating theft, loitering, policy violations, employee inefficiency and other anomalies. When the AI flags an event, our human reviewers validate and categorize it before sending it to you — eliminating false positives and ensuring actionable alerts.</p>
        <p>Our team of programmers continually refines these algorithms to adapt to evolving threats and environments. They work hand‑in‑hand with our surveillance professionals, blending machine speed with human judgment for superior accuracy.</p>
      </div>
      <!-- Feature block: Instant Notifications -->
      <div class="detail-block reveal">
        <h2>Instant Notifications</h2>
        <p>Staying informed is essential when seconds count. We deliver alerts the moment our team confirms an incident. Choose to receive notifications via WhatsApp, email or Slack — or all of them. We can also integrate with other messaging platforms on request.</p>
        <p>Beyond security alerts, you can opt in to receive operational updates and business intelligence reports, allowing you to adjust staffing, merchandising or store layouts in real time.</p>
      </div>
      <!-- Feature block: Business Analytics -->
      <div class="detail-block reveal">
        <h2>Business Analytics</h2>
        <p>Your cameras are a treasure trove of data. We unlock it. Our analytics suite counts foot traffic, measures dwell times, generates heat maps and tracks how people interact with products. We report group sizes, identify bottlenecks and highlight underutilized areas.</p>
        <p>These insights help you optimize staffing schedules, improve store layouts, reduce wait times and increase conversions. Armed with data about how customers move and behave, you can make informed strategic decisions to improve your bottom line.</p>
